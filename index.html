                    <p>
                       Students are required to meet certain medical encounters during their training. 
                       This is logged electronically and evaluated at the end of the students' training. 
                       If a student does not have a certain encounter by the end of the training a simulated 
                       version of the encounter must be experienced, such as through computer cases, simulations, 
                       readings, etc. All of these encounters need to be recorded in such a way to support reporting 
                       of the encounters, whether the encounter was live or some alternative, and the total percentage 
                       of alternative encounters.

                       <li>A report can show the percentage of students that experienced the simulated encounter</li>
                       <li>A report can show the type of encounter, if the encounter was simulated</li>

                    <h2>Potential Solution</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md">Experience API (xAPI)</a> offers a solution by 
                        storing the encounter data as xAPI Statements, and providing a way to retrieve that data. Encoding the data for later reports 
                        is the largest consideration in the formatting of the encounters. The following breaks down the statement.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Storage (Encoding) of the Encounters</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Actor</h4>
                    <p>
                        The actor portion of the Statement uniquely identifies the student. The "account" attribute was 
                        used for this demonstration to remove any personally identifiable information, since the account "name" 
                        attribute can be anything, such as some identification number.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
"actor": {
    "name": "jono",
    "account": {
        "homePage": "http://adlnet.gov/demo/accounts/encounter",
        "name": "ABC123"
    }
}
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    <h4>Verb</h4>
                    <p>
                        The verb of the Statement identifies the action taking place. Since all of the tracking was related 
                        to 'encounters', the verb 'encountered' was coined for use in this example.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
"verb": {
    "id": "http://adlnet.gov/demo/verb/medical/encountered",
    "display": {
        "en-US": "encountered"
    }
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <h4>Object</h4>
                    <p>
                        The object identifies the encounter, such as patient with chest pain. 
                        The type attribute is used to indicate the type of encounter, ie. was 
                        it live, if not, what type of simulation was it?
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
"object": {
    "id": "http://adlnet.gov/demo/encounter/chest-pain",
    "definition": {
        "name": {
            "en-US": "patient with chest pain"
        },
        "type": "http://adlnet.gov/demo/encounter/type/alternate/reading"
    }
}
                    </code></pre>

                    <h4>Context</h4>
                    <p>
                        The context object used in this scenario is mainly for 
                        searchability. Using the category activities as 
                        <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md#details-15">'tags'</a> 
                        allows the reporting system to 
                        query a subset of statements in the LRS. For example, the IRI 
                        "http://adlnet.gov/demo/profile/medical-encounter" allows the report 
                        to retrieve only the Statements that follow this data format. And 
                        the IRI "http://adlnet.gov/demo/encounter/type/alternate" allows 
                        the report to query the LRS for only alternate encounters.
                    </p>
